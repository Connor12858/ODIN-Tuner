This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Front End
## Visible
This is a typescript site that will take a file input of `.odni` only. From here we send a api request to [**ODIN Tuner Backend**](https://github.com/Connor12858/odin-tuner-backends) to get the values from the file.

## Hosting
Vercel host's the site at [ODIN-Tuner](https://odin-tuner.vercel.app/). It will automatically update the site when there is a new commit.

# Back End
The backend is all locatted at another [git repo](https://github.com/Connor12858/odin-tuner-backends) that uses [render](https://render.com/).
